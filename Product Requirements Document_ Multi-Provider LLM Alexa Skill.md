# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Provider LLM Alexa Skill

**Product Name:** AI Assistant Pro (Placeholder)
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Prepared By:** Manus AI

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Goal

The primary goal of the **AI Assistant Pro** Alexa Skill is to provide users with a secure and flexible voice interface to interact with their preferred Large Language Model (LLM) provider. This skill will act as a central hub, allowing users to configure and utilize their own API keys for services like OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude, ensuring they maintain control over their usage and costs.

### 1.2. Background

The demand for voice-enabled access to advanced generative AI is rapidly increasing. Existing Alexa skills often limit users to a single, proprietary model or a fixed service. This product addresses the need for a customizable, multi-provider solution that respects user ownership of their API credentials.

### 1.3. Success Metrics

*   **User Adoption:** 1,000 unique users within the first 3 months.
*   **Retention:** 40% of users who link an API key use the skill at least once a week.
*   **Security Compliance:** Zero reported security vulnerabilities related to API key storage.
*   **Provider Diversity:** At least 2 of the 3 supported providers are actively used by a significant user base (e.g., >10% of active users).

## 3. Technical Requirements and Architecture

### 3.1. Architecture Overview

The skill will utilize the standard Alexa Skill Kit (ASK) architecture with an AWS Lambda function as the backend endpoint.

**Programming Language:** Python (3.11+) is the preferred language due to its robust and well-maintained libraries for all three target LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI).

**AWS Services Stack:**
*   **Alexa Skill Kit (ASK):** Frontend interaction model.
*   **AWS Lambda:** Core business logic and backend execution.
*   **Amazon DynamoDB:** Persistent storage for user preferences and encrypted API keys.
*   **AWS Key Management Service (KMS):** Cryptographic service for encrypting and decrypting user API keys.
*   **Amazon API Gateway + AWS Lambda:** Used for the secure, out-of-session web portal for API key configuration.
*   **Amazon S3:** Used for hosting the static assets of the secure web portal.

*   **Frontend:** Alexa Voice Service (AVS) and the Alexa Skill Interaction Model.
*   **Backend:** AWS Lambda (Node.js or Python) will handle all skill logic, including intent handling, API key retrieval, and communication with the LLM providers.
*   **Data Storage:** **Amazon DynamoDB** will be used for persistent user data, including the encrypted API keys and user preferences (default provider, model choice).

### 3.2. Secure API Key Storage (Crucial Requirement)

User-provided API keys **MUST** be stored securely.

1.  **Encryption:** API keys will be encrypted using **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** with a dedicated Customer Managed Key (CMK).
2.  **Storage:** The encrypted key will be stored in an **Amazon DynamoDB** table, partitioned by the unique Alexa User ID.
3.  **Access Control:** The Lambda function's IAM role will be the *only* entity authorized to decrypt the key using the KMS CMK.
4.  **Transmission:** The API key will *never* be transmitted to the user's device or stored in unencrypted logs. It will be decrypted in the Lambda function's memory just before the LLM API call and immediately discarded.

### 3.3. Provider Integration

The Lambda function will include a modular **LLM Abstraction Layer** to handle the specific API calls and request/response formats for each provider (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic). This layer will normalize the input and output, allowing the core skill logic to be provider-agnostic.

**Key Technical Requirements for Abstraction Layer:**
1.  **Input Normalization:** Convert the Alexa-provided user query and session context into a standardized `prompt` and `history` object.
2.  **Provider Routing:** Based on the user's default provider or an explicit voice command, route the standardized request to the correct provider-specific API client.
3.  **Output Normalization:** Convert the provider's API response (text, sometimes with metadata) into a clean text string suitable for Alexa's Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) output.
4.  **Error Mapping:** Map provider-specific errors (e.g., rate limits, invalid keys, context length issues) to standardized error codes and user-friendly voice responses.

**API Key Configuration Flow (Technical Steps):**
1.  **Secure Web Portal:** A dedicated microservice (e.g., AWS API Gateway + Lambda) will serve a minimal, secure web page.
2.  **User Authentication:** The web page must securely link the session to the Alexa User ID. This can be achieved by using the `account linking` feature or by generating a unique, time-limited token in the Alexa card that is passed to the web portal. **The token approach is preferred for simplicity and security segregation.**
3.  **Encryption on Ingestion:** Upon submission, the API key is immediately encrypted using the KMS CMK *before* being written to the DynamoDB table. The key is never stored unencrypted, even in the ingestion service's logs.
4.  **Decryption on Demand:** The main Alexa Lambda function will retrieve the encrypted key and use the KMS `Decrypt` API call to get the plaintext key, which is held only in memory for the duration of the LLM API call.

## 4. User Experience (UX)

### 4.1. Alexa Interaction Model (Voice Commands)

The skill will primarily use a single custom intent, `LLMQueryIntent`, to capture the user's request. Provider selection will be handled via slot values or by parsing the raw utterance.

| Intent Name | Sample Utterances | Slots | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `LLMQueryIntent` | "Ask {Provider} {Query}" | `Provider` (Custom Slot Type: OpenAI, Gemini, Claude), `Query` (AMAZON.SearchQuery) | The main intent for all LLM interactions. |
| `SetDefaultProviderIntent` | "Set {Provider} as my default" | `Provider` | Allows the user to select their default LLM. |
| `ClearContextIntent` | "Start a new conversation" | N/A | Clears the session history for a fresh start. |
| `HelpIntent` | "Help" | N/A | Provides instructions on how to use the skill and link an API key. |

### 4.2. Onboarding and Key Configuration Flow

1.  **First-Time Invocation:** User says, "Alexa, open AI Assistant Pro."
2.  **Skill Response:** "Welcome to AI Assistant Pro. To begin, you need to link your API key. I have sent a card to your Alexa app with instructions."
3.  **Alexa App Card:** The card will contain a unique, time-sensitive link to a secure web portal (hosted on AWS, e.g., using API Gateway + Lambda + S3).
4.  **Web Portal:** The user selects their provider and securely enters their API key. The key is immediately encrypted and stored in DynamoDB, linked to the user's Alexa ID.
5.  **Confirmation:** The web portal confirms success, and the skill announces, "Your key is linked! You can now say, 'Ask OpenAI, what is the capital of France?'"

### 4.3. Voice Interaction Examples

| Scenario | User Utterance | Skill Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Specific Provider** | "Ask **Gemini**, what is the best way to learn Python?" | "Gemini says: The best way to learn Python is..." |
| **Set Default** | "Set **Claude** as my default provider." | "Okay, Claude is now your default. You can now just ask your question." |
| **Follow-up** | "What about for a beginner?" (after a previous question) | (The skill uses the previous context and the default provider to answer.) |
| **Missing Key** | "Ask OpenAI to write a poem." | "Your OpenAI key is not linked. Please check the Alexa app for instructions on how to link your key." |

## 5. Future Considerations

*   **Cost Tracking:** Implement a feature to track and report estimated usage costs based on LLM provider tokens.
*   **Model Selection:** Allow users to specify a specific model within a provider (e.g., "Ask OpenAI using GPT-4o...").
*   **Custom Prompts:** Enable users to define a custom "system prompt" for their default provider via the web portal.

## 6. Security and Compliance

### 6.1. Security Requirements

| Requirement ID | Requirement | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-001 | **KMS Encryption** | All user-provided API keys must be encrypted at rest using AWS KMS. |
| SEC-002 | **Least Privilege** | The Lambda execution role must be restricted to *only* DynamoDB read/write for the user table and KMS `Decrypt` for the CMK. It must *not* have `Encrypt` or `GenerateDataKey` permissions. |
| SEC-003 | **Token-Based Auth** | The API key configuration portal must use a single-use, time-limited token to map the web session to the Alexa User ID, avoiding the need for full account linking or user logins. |
| SEC-004 | **Data Retention** | Implement a policy to securely delete a user's API key and preferences from DynamoDB upon skill disablement (via the Alexa Skill Events API). |
| SEC-005 | **Input Sanitization** | All user voice input must be sanitized before being passed to the LLM APIs to prevent prompt injection or other security vulnerabilities. |

### 6.2. Open Questions and Decisions

| Question | Decision / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| What is the desired maximum response length for the voice response? | **Decision:** Maximum response length is **90 seconds** (approx. 200-250 words). Longer responses must be truncated with a voice prompt like, "The full response is too long for voice. I have sent the complete answer to your Alexa app card." |
| Should the web portal for key configuration be hosted within the same AWS account or a separate one? | **Decision:** Host the portal in the **same AWS account** for simplified IAM and KMS access, but in a separate, isolated VPC/Subnet and with strict security group rules. The Lambda function for the portal should only have `KMS:Encrypt` and `DynamoDB:PutItem` permissions. |
| What is the preferred programming language for the Lambda function? | **Decision:** **Python (3.11+)** for its superior ecosystem for LLM integrations and asynchronous programming capabilities. |
